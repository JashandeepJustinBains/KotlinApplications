Feature Explanation:  
    
    There are 4 modes available in the app. Pen, Highlight, Erase are active when the corresponding button is pressed. When no button is pressed you can only 2 finger pan/zoom. While a button is pressed you can use 2 finger pan/zoom and 1 finger draw with the corresponding tool.

    Panning and Zooming are implemented with the 2 finger drag and pinch/spread android emulator functions respectivly.

    User can Erase Annotations in the way that mimics real life erasing rather than stroke erasing.

    User can Undo-Redo, The redo stack will be cleared after the user writes something new. Undo-Redo is page specific so as to not mistakenly undo/redo something on a different page by accident.
